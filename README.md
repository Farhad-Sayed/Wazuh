## 1. Introduction to Wazuh

### 1.1 Background
Wazuh is an open-source security information and event management (SIEM) tool designed to enhance the security posture of organizations by providing real-time threat detection, incident response, and compliance management. It originated as a fork of the OSSEC project and has since evolved to offer a more robust and scalable solution.

### 1.2 Key Features
Wazuh offers a range of features to address the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats:
- **Log Analysis:** Wazuh analyzes log data from various sources, including operating systems, applications, and network devices, to identify potential security incidents.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Wazuh uses IDS capabilities to monitor network and system activities, detecting and alerting on potential security breaches.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** The system scans for vulnerabilities in the environment, helping organizations identify and address weaknesses in their systems.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Wazuh monitors changes to critical files and directories, alerting administrators to unauthorized modifications, potentially indicative of a security incident.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Wazuh provides a centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and managing security events, facilitating efficient incident response.

## 2. Vulnerability Detection

### 2.1 Importance of Vulnerability Detection
Vulnerability detection is the process of identifying vulnerabilities in software and systems. Wazuh provides vulnerability detection capabilities by scanning systems for known vulnerabilities and providing alerts when vulnerabilities are detected. Identifying and patching vulnerabilities before they can be exploited is essential for maintaining a secure IT environment. Wazuh offers robust vulnerability detection capabilities to help organizations stay ahead of potential threats.

### 2.2 Wazuh Vulnerability Detection Process
Wazuh employs various methods to detect vulnerabilities:
- **Network Scanning:** Wazuh can perform network scans to identify devices and services running in the environment. It then cross-references this information with known vulnerabilities to highlight potential risks.
- **CVE Integration:** Wazuh integrates with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, providing up-to-date information on known vulnerabilities.
- **Real-time Alerts:** The system generates real-time alerts when vulnerabilities are detected, allowing administrators to take immediate action.
- **Customizable Policies:** Organizations can define custom vulnerability detection policies to align with their specific security requirements.

## 3. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

### 3.1 Significance of File Integrity Monitoring
File integrity monitoring is the process of monitoring files and directories for unauthorized changes. Wazuh provides file integrity monitoring capabilities by monitoring files and directories and triggering an alert when a user or process creates, modifies, or deletes monitored files. It runs a baseline scan, storing the cryptographic checksum and other attributes of the monitored files. When a user or process changes a file, the module compares its checksum and attributes to the baseline, triggering an alert if it finds a mismatch.

FIM is crucial for detecting unauthorized changes to critical system files, configurations, and directories, helping organizations maintain the integrity and security of their systems by promptly identifying and responding to potential breaches.

### 3.2 Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Wazuh continuously monitors file and directory changes in real-time, detecting alterations as soon as they occur.
- **Baseline Configuration:** Administrators can establish baseline configurations for critical files, allowing Wazuh to identify any deviations from the norm.
- **Alerting and Reporting:** Wazuh generates alerts and reports when unauthorized changes are detected, providing detailed information for investigation.
- **Integration with SIEM:** FIM events are seamlessly integrated into the overall security event management, providing a holistic view of the organization's security posture.

## 4. Conclusion
Wazuh offers a comprehensive security solution with advanced features for vulnerability detection and file integrity monitoring. By integrating these capabilities into their cybersecurity strategy, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to potential security incidents, ultimately bolstering their overall cybersecurity posture. As threats continue to evolve, Wazuh remains a valuable tool for organizations seeking to stay ahead in the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity.
